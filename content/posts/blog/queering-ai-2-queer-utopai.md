## About us 

*We are running a programme of workshops this year around the theme of Queering AI - we have a cohort of queer participants who will be attending the workshops and sharing resources throughout the process.*   

*Together, we will explore dominant imaginaries of AI through queer creativity, and share tools to form queer connections with technology. At the end of the workshop series, we will produce a collective manifesto for queering AI.* 

*You can find a summary of our[ previous workshop here.](https://www.machine-streams.com/blog/post/queering-ai-1-getting-to-know-each-other-groundwork-and-strategies/)*

## Workshop #2! 

For our June event we held a workshop on imagining the concept of Utopia, led by Francesco Bentivegna, using AI tools as our “collaborators”. We had two hopes for the day -  

Firstly, we wanted to spark conversation about what utopia could mean for queer people. What concepts, ideas, values and systems could we imagine and creatively respond to? Could that imagining affect our reality? In our last workshop we looked at strategies that queer people use to survive and thrive in a hostile world - could we build on those to imagine a perfect world, or at least a better world for queer people? 

A launch text for this was Muñoz’s Cruising Utopia. Queerness is "not simply a being but a doing for and toward the future" (Muñoz, Cruising Utopia 1). "Ultimately, we must insist on a queer futurity because the present is so poisonous and insolvent" (Muñoz, Cruising Utopia 30)

Our second aim was to introduce the dominant AI tools and technologies to our cohort, and interrogate the content it reflects back to us. 

ChatGPT and image generators have dominated the recent marketplace for this new generation of AI tools, with most casual users becoming familiar in some way with constructing ‘prompts’ for the AI to calculate an output. 

We wanted to turn the process of using these tools into a feedback loop. Both humans and machines took turns to do the computations and imagining -  passing prompts to the AI tools and then using the outputs as prompts for human creativity, and then passing back to the AI to see what would be generated. Could we use an LLM effectively as a scrying tool, to put our hopes and dreams into it, and see how the technology’s own “dreaming” would affect ours? Would an AI image generator be able to reflect the complexities and subtleties of a queer utopia? If both tools fell short of our human-made imaginings, what would that expose about the underlying systems behind this technology? 

## The background theory 

We started the day by discussing a brief history of utopias and dystopias, and what queer and trans utopias could look like. We explored examples from Norse mythology to music festivals- situating us in the context of imagined and real utopias across time and space. We often turn to Western imaginings of utopia, assuming that idea of utopia originated from Plato- there is important decolonial work to do to deconstruct the Western and white utopian myths.

We also set the context of the tools we were using - no technology is neutral, and AI in particular is objectively harmful and extractive. There is a danger when using LLM’s or image generators that it seems like ‘magic’ and we wanted to ensure that we were not perpetuating this abstraction. To ensure this we did a quick primer of the high-level basics of how LLMs and text-to-image systems work - we think understanding the ‘stochastic parrot’ nature of the tools was a good start to using these tools in a rational yet playful way. 

## Human / AI collaboration 

The discussion lead into a fun and free-flowing conversation between humans and computers - our participants took turns imagining and creating their own stories, acting as processors of prompts from other teams, and using AI to feed and metabolise these prompts. 

The responses from our participants were subtle, varied and empathetic. Their visions for a queer utopia centred care, freedom, cooperation and love. They were decidedly anti-capitalist, anti-classist, anti-racist in their values - prioritising health, community and mutual aid. Some key values that were shared; 

to be cared for

it is okay to bring baggage

acknowledgement of people’s past 

a sense of peace

holding space for pain

When these ideas were fed into both an LLM and several text-to-image generators we began to bump up against the texture and limits of the tools. Both the text and images responses were “bland”, “corporate” and basically unimaginative.  

The LLM struggled to speak in a non-corporate voice or grasp the subtleties of our concepts.  The images trended towards uncanny yet sexualised women, or generic “fantasy” like cityscapes. They particularly struggled with imagining new types of technology that didn’t mimic the shape of phones or computers. By showing us what we do not want in a queer utopia, it helped us to think more intricately about what we do want.

From my perspective, the response from the AI revealed the nature of the “soup” that had fed it - mainstream patriarchal and capitalist culture. They are tools which respond to the money markets and the empire of Big Tech, not the collective needs of marginalised communities.  



If the AI were trained on content from Queer, disabled, anti-racist, anti-capitalist, etc. culture, would it be able to provide content of more value? Is there a way to use AI that could serve our utopian ideals? Or is AI’s essential nature antithetical to our ideas of a queer utopia? We hope to interrogate this further in our upcoming workshops!
