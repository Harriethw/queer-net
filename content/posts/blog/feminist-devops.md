QueerTech Bristol is a monthly meetup for queers who work with/in/around or have a general interest in technology. Our February event was on the topic of feminist DevOps, with a talk from an experienced sysadmin, Julia Hawkes-Reed. We touched on some wide-ranging themes of oppressive systems, design thinking and team values that I think can apply to our daily work and life.

I’ve been interested in alternative ways of computing for a while now, having undertaken an artist’s residency last year on the theme of low tech internet infrastructure, which was partly inspired by something I’d read online - the Feminist Server Manifesto [(you can read more about it here).](https://hub.xpub.nl/systers/mediawiki/index.php?title=A_Feminist_Server_Manifesto)

There was one point in particular that shook me to my core:

*\> Tries hard not to apologise when she is sometimes not available*

The idea that a website should be always on and instantly available has been so fundamental to everything I’ve learnt professionally that I went down a rabbit hole of readings and research to find other challenges to the tenets held by corporate IT departments.

Our QueerTech event came about when I shared the Feminist Server Manifesto with Julia, who was working on her own theory of DevOps as a feminist act. The manifesto contains some provocative assertions, such as that a server “tries hard not to apologise when she is sometimes not available”. Julia disagreed with a lot of the manifesto from her own experience working in DevOps teams (before the term DevOps even existed!) - so we set up a workshop to get the conversation started within our community.

What came out of it was a fascinating and expansive conversation between our attendees, who ranged from art students to CTO’s. It illuminated for me the nature of DevOps as a microcosm of the tech industry as a whole.

In some organisations, teams will replicate and reinforce existing prejudices and power dynamics inherent in the industry. In others, they will manage to carve out practices of freedom, empowerment and change.

These are the four provocations from Julia’s talk and the discussion that spoke to me. They might resonate with you the next time you’re staring at a broken CI pipeline or struggling to write a Jira ticket:

*\> Anarcho-syndicalism is the best way to run a tech team*

There have been many consultants and business-type people who have come up with endless theories about agile working, but they often focus on the best way to increase profit or managerial control. What if teams were self-organising? If ndividuals had agency over their work?


*\> Be ruthless to systems, be kind to people - Michael Brooks*


We need to work with both empathy and pragmatism when trying to make things better.


*\> All software/hardware is bad (welcome to womanhood)*


Just like jeans with pockets that are too small, every software and system we engage with is going to have flaws that reflect the biases of the people who designed it.


*\> The purpose of a system is what it does.*


A systems thinking theory from Stafford Beer, which we saw as applying to corporate systems - if you make it hard for a dyslexic person to use your service then the purpose is to exclude that person - as well as the infrastructure of Big Tech - if you’re using tons of water every minute to cool your computers to run ChatGPT, then the purpose of the system is climate catastrophe.
