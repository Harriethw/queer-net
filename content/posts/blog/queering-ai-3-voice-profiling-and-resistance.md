For our third workshop in late September we were joined by the designer, researcher and vocal performer Amina Abbas-Nazari to run a workshop on speculative voice and AI. 



Amina’s project Speculative Voicing is an ongoing investigation of sonic materiality in human and synthetic voice communication, especially in conjunction with AI and other emerging technologies. You can hear more about their research in the recording of this talk they gave as part of [Queering AI at the Pervasive Media Studio.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kR1FZO9mUM&list=PLbP2rruaw4OvyHmG5tYtqgtJ67xIJ5rOf&index=7)



Amina took us through a workshop in which we discussed the concept of voice and how it can be changed and manipulated by technology, and then co-created an audio piece formed from our own vocal experiments. 



## The voice versus AI



Amina gave a brief overview of their research into how AI uses the data extracted from voices to further the agenda of capitalism and the patriarchy, and how a queer or speculative voice might resist this extraction through diversity and co-creation.



Amina shared a quote from Edward Kang - who posits that voice is a “fixed, extractable and measurable “sound object” located within the body.” That is how AI would like to see voice as well - as something objective, definitive and isolated. By flattening out “noise”, nuance or diversity from the voice, the technology can make better decisions on how to sell products, enforce systems and place people into data boxes. 



Amina wants to suggest a different meaning of voice - that sound and voice are co-created with the body, environment and other bodies around the speaker. A speculative way of understanding voice could be that it is polyphonic - humans have many voices, we speak differently depending on the role or circumstances. The voice is embodied, it moves through our flesh, bone and muscles. 



Amina shared some research from IBM to understand how this organisation understands voice, and found that they see voice as - singular, fixed, stable, objective, knowable, in a vacuum, binary, normative. Whereas a “speculative voice” could be - sonic, multiple, co-created, subject, malleable, non-binary.



We then watched a video about the unbounded potential of the human voice, featuring performance artist Elaine Mitchener uttering one syllable - ‘no’.  [You can see the performance here.](https://fraenkelgallery.com/conversations/watch/elaine-mitchener-performs-christian-marclays-no)



Human voice has potential that is infinite, unpredictable and expansive, in a way that AI might never capture, and in this limitless we can find resistance.

## Playing and making



For our first exercise we used open software (Max) with customised tools made by Amina to create our own sounds with our voices. The prompt was to keep it brief, to one or two words or even just one syllable, and then to play around with sound effects that distorted the voice. Some of the effects added choruses of different voices, others distorted it towards unrecognisable robotic/alien sounds, adding static, noise and other diffusions.



When we re-grouped to play our sounds, there was a range of responses and emotions, which we’ve anonymised below.



A - wanted to capture the feeling of coming out of the water with a bubbly, rising sound. They were thinking about the noise of bubbles and words that sound like the thing or the feeling they describe.

B - shared what sounded like a chorus of voices with imperfections and a layering of his own different types of voices. We all have aspects of ourselves that come out at different times, different versions of ourselves that still make up a unified self. We discussed how usually plosive sounds and breath sounds are removed in recordings, but we liked that they were included in this track as it sounded very human and textured.

C - made some very sci-fi glitchy sounds that ranged between distorted and less-distorted. When Z heard their voice come through the audio they wanted to mask it’s sound and thought about how if an AI voice was to be created they wouldn’t want to be reflected in it

D - layered sounds of their voice with effects from the machine and explored their desire to change their voice to become deeper and more masculine, how this would be their ideal speaking voice.

E - said the word “churros” and included an emphatic rolling of their r’s, as the word had significance to them. They also played a snippet of a recording where they say “this didn’t work”, which we discussed as something that AI would never include, as it does not “think out loud”.

F - wanted a “dependable, solid Dyke voice”, for example to give directions on google maps. But they struggled with getting a recording that sounded right. They made several recordings of the word “dyke” which harmonised and pitched higher and higher. 



For the next part of the workshop, we performed as an ‘improv choir’, using our sounds to create a live performance together.

## Reflection



This playful exercise highlighted the importance and emotional significance of voice as queer people. We discussed the idea that many queer people resist the concept of one single “normal” form of voice, especially if they are in transition or “code switching” between different environments. There are many ways to think about what your voice is, the many identities you can hold, and which voice you would like to use at any given moment.



We also reflected on the potentially helpful uses of AI technology and voice - such as tools used to capture the voices of people with degenerative conditions, enabling those people to use their voice through technology after their own body cannot. Despite these potentially life-changing and truly helpful applications of AI, corporations are using it to profile, control and sell to people.
