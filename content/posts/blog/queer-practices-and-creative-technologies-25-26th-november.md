**Harriet Horobin-Worley** **Sound and Vision- Building Our Own Networks**

What networks do we use as queer people, and how can we use radio to imagine a future network; a radio built, owned, operated and used by queer people? 

What part has the radio played in your life What are your memories of listening to the radio? Where did you listen to it, and who with? If you could broadcast anything on the radio, what would you like to broadcast? What would the perfect communications network look like to you? Who would build it, what would it look like? Would it be global or local? What senses would it make use of? What message would you like to leave for people who are entering this imagined network for the first time? How would you welcome them?

**[ MELT](http://meltionary.com/) (Ren Loren Britton and Iz Paehr) methods/sdohtem**

Through Disability Justice and Trans*feminisms, we experimented with methods like starting twice, talking twice, undoing binaries, describing carefully, naming needs, reading nonlinearly and engaging with material agencies to answer the question how do we set up a value based practice?

**Yudi Wu What is VTubing and How do I Make it Gay?**

How could the extremely online queer people contribute to their local queer community? How could local queer communities benefit from the digital world? 

Inspired by the 2000s queer icons, the queer communities in VR Chat & VTuber world, and Bristol's wonderful local queer scene, we imagined what a VTuber and the world they would live in would look like in speculative empowered queer community. 

You can explore the workshops, conversations and artistic responses through the zine Harriet and Katy made after!
