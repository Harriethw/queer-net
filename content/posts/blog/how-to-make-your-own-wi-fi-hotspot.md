How has drag changed over covid? What effect has technology had on how we perform? How might we give voice to new parts of ourselves through technology?



Join us for an evening of discussion and workshopping as we dive into the themes of drag, gender, alter-egos, and technology. 



In collaboration with, and supported by, the fantastic Container Magazine - an online magazine that takes a human look at technology, exploring how people use it for creative projects, community-building and social justice. 



// Line up //



We’ll have an introductory talk from Oluwatayo Adewole. Oluwatayo Adewole is a writer, critic and multidisciplinary artist, her interest lies in forms being pushed to the limit. His talk will be about how shifting technologies are changing the landscape of drag and queer performance.



Our next host is artist Elly Clarke. will take us through a workshop on alter egos 





// Refreshments // 



We will have a light dinner with vegan options available for our attendees. 



// Location //



We'll be in the Pervasive Media (PM) Studio at the Watershed. There is step-free access via a lift, but is a bit hidden away in the building, so here’s some directions - if you get stuck ask a member of staff where the PM Studio is:

\* Go to the cafe/bar

\* When looking at the bar, you’ll see some double doors to the left of it

\* Go through these double doors, past the toilets. Follow the corridor further along and there will be a doorbell to ring for the Pervasive Media Studio



We will email out a contact email before the event so please check your spam folder!





There are tea-making facilities at the studio. You're welcome to bring your own food and drink or buy them at the bar.
