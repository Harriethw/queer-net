Batool Desouky is a computational artist working in code, drawing, physical computing and writing, researching Arabic ritual practices to explore decolonial histories for technology.


They joined us in November 2024 to run a workshop on Protocols of Queer Conduct. 



## What are Protocols? 



Handshakes, greetings, HTTPS, FTP, SSH - these are all protocols, whether they determine how humans interact with other humans, or how computers talk to each other. Batool pointed out that in many cases these rules have not been determined by a local community or by the users that they affect - and many people are forced to follow implicit protocols that don’t work for them (such as neurodivergent people who don’t enjoy handshakes or hugs). 

## 
Codes of Conduct



Codes of conduct are similar to protocols, but they are more of a collaborative document made by people in a team and are ideally a collective, living agreement on how we want to run a space. 

Together we looked at a few codes of conduct that Batool shared - including OpenAI’s Supplier Code of Conduct, and code of conducts and contributor guidelines for open source software.

We discussed how many of these documents speak to valuing equity and diversity, but Batool encouraged us to question how often these values are reflected in the realities of the organisations. Does the Code of Conduct itself almost preclude any further work or thought on behalf of these organisations? Are they empty gestures, “a palliative bandage”, to signal a certain workplace or community culture, and if so is that necessarily a bad thing?

Many of the guides and values are explicitly against conflict or provide no real tools to resolve disagreements  - what would happen if the values and behaviour they propose was really challenged?

Queer Code of Conduct for ChatGPT


In order to start tackling some of these questions ourselves, we dove into an exercise of writing our own Code of Conduct for interacting with ChatGPT. What would a queer protocol look like? Or could we queer the act of using ChatGPT?

We assembled our code in this pad:

We used the Queering Damage generative protocols as a loose framework to apply to our thoughts after we had gathered a few point:

Some highlights were:

* ChatGPT is not a human nor a being beyond humanity. When referring to AI we should use tool-specific and precise language.
* * Using magical or abstracted language about ChatGPT only serves to hide its material reality as a tool created by people.
* Don’t ask ChatGPT for anything if you expect to receive facts
* * The implied neutrality of technology is not taken as a given. All outputs, biases, behaviours of this platform can and should be retraced to an accountable human or groups of humans (the developer,the entrepreneur, the capitalist). 
* The lack of transparency around AI data is extremely concerning, especially to marginalised or vulnerable people.
* * As one attendee wrote, “Ominous feeling of where this knowledge has come from, what datasets have been harvested, what consent has been breached to gain that, and what assumptions are made of users because of these datasets.”

  * Our protocols required this transparency and an ethical use of data.

This was a great exercise to do as we prepared to create our Queering AI Manifesto, and highlighted the opportunities and challenges of creating these types of documents and resources. Just the act of getting together as a group and exploring the values we’d like to put forward to the world can be really rewarding and enjoyable - it’s a chance to share knowledge, research, clarify our own thinking and form bonds with our collaborators. In that sense, writing a Code of Conduct or a Manifesto is never a waste of time for those involved. 

In our next workshop we will explore how a Manifesto might live beyond the time and place it is created.
