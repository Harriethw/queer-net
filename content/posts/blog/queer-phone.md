Could a telephone line offer more intimate and meaningful ways of communicating with our community as queer people?  Can we use audio to form new intimacies, express new stories and build resilient networks outside of the umbrella of Big Tech?

These are questions we are seeking to answer with an ongoing DIY server/telephone project - Queer Phone.

 <https://www.queerphone.com/>  (website design by the amazing Maks)

You can call now (+44) 0117-214-1269 to speak to our Raspberry Pi server running in one of our living rooms - as of June 2025 we are hosting queer poetry and voice notes.

We've also produced a zine if you would like to know how to start your own telephone project:

The project aims to repurpose and expand the way we can use our mobile phones to connect to our community - to provide a space for new forms of voices and a resource for new ways of feeling and being together. We want to provide a counter to the expansive yet extractive promises of the social media on our phones and hegemonic communication networks that have led to people, especially marginalised groups, feeling detached and alienated from the community around them. As artist Paul Chan writes "communication technology has increased communication and decreased understanding”.

We believe that reducing the experience of communication to simple and direct sound (or transcripts for users who require them) facilitates a freedom of expression between people who are connected through their queerness. In turn, the telephone line allows for a web of disembodied voices to share ways of caring, of desire and of recognition. 

Talking on the phone as a form of social life has decreased in recent generations, yet the use of voice notes amongst friends and lovers shows the desire for voice to be part of the tapestry of our communication. There are few things more intimate and private than listening to someone’s voice, whether through headphones or with your phone nestled against your cheek. 

We also love the idea that someone is calling our server directly, that it will live in our home, and we will be caring for and customising the technology that answers callers, free from surveillance technology and AI, using low tech/old hardware. We will draw on historical and present-day practices of LGBTQIA and DIY communication technologies - from zines to messageboards to WhatsApp groups - to provide moments of connection, intimacy and joy.

We will host more "events" and sounds throughout the summer - for now you can keep up to date via Harriet's Mastodon account <https://mas.to/@harriethw >
