## About us

We are running a programme of workshops this year around the theme of Queering AI - we have a cohort of queer participants who will be attending the workshops and sharing resources throughout the process. 



Together, we will explore dominant imaginaries of AI through queer creativity, and share tools to form queer connections with technology. At the end of the workshop series, we will produce a collective manifesto for queering AI.



## The first workshop!

Saturday 4th May was our first official meeting, on a lovely sunny day in Bristol. As many of us had never met, we wanted our first session to ease everyone into the process, get to know each other and see what common interests and goals we might have. 



Our feature artist was Chloe Meineck- an artist, co-designer, community builder and activist who combines craft, co-design and interactive technologies to explore care, repair and identity. 



Chloe suggested an initial exercise to help break the ice and help us discover and visualise the complex web of connections between us. Here’s how we ran it:

### Luggage Tag Exercise

#### **What you’ll need:**

Lengths of twine or string - a little more than 1 per pair, roughly 50cm or enough to be long enough for people to stand holding each end comfortably,

Cardboard/paper luggage tags - as long as they have a hole at the end to put the string through

Pens - 1 per pair

#### How long you’ll need: 

About 20-30 mins

#### Instructions:

1. Participants split into pairs, with a luggage tag and 1 or more pieces of string

2. Take 5 minutes to discover at least 1 thing you have in common - this could be favourite foods, locations, hobbies, people they know. This could be more than 1 thing. Write them down on the luggage tag.

3. After 5 minutes, thread the luggage tag onto the string and each member of the pair holds one end.

4. Find another pair to talk to and discover something you have in common - it could be what’s already written on the tags or new things. Tie your strings together and continue holding on to the strings

5. Keep rotating pairs until everyone has spoken - you should end up with a beautiful, messy web of connections that everyone is holding together!



We ended up finding out surprising facts about each other (hating/loving mushrooms! A lot of people like wild swimming) and having a bit of a laugh - it was a really nice way to start the programme.



## Queer Strategies



After lunch, we started Chloe’s workshop on Queer Strategies. This had three main parts - we talked about what queer meant to us, the queer strategies we use and collaborative zine making. 



When talking about what queerness means to them, one person described queerness as a warm, fuzzy umbrella. Chloe shared definitions by José Esteban Muñoz and bell hooks. Another person shared how queerness is an anti-identity identity, an absence of specificity that allows them to exist just as they are. 

A queer strategy could be anything from wearing headphones to walk down the street, to building community, or making art. There were a few main themes that came out of our conversation and brainstorming:

* Masking and role playing

  * Hiding symptoms/feelings and values when unsafe            	
* Embodying different gender roles and signifiers

  * Queer spaces and community building
  * Creating your own queer family
* Relationship with nature

  * Healing and creativity in the natural world
* Taking up space

  * Being aggressive and authentic
  * Pushing back
* Silliness, Perception of the world 

  * Gender presentation and gender reaffirming behaviour
* Queer joy

The results of the workshop will be made into a zine that will be shared as a tool for other queer people to use, add to and recreate. 

## How do we apply this to AI/tech? 

At the end of the Queer Strategies workshop we gathered to reflect on the strategies that emerged, and focused on a guided meditation where everyone had a chance to do some free writing/drawing/voice-noting. 

Fran asked the group to imagine how they would like to see AI being used in the future, and what AI means to them. Rather than sharing them with each other that day, we decided to store them in envelopes and read them all out in our last workshop in November to create a thread from beginning to end. 

While some of the topics we’ve talked about may seem quite remote to AI, in this programme we would like to take a holistic view of technology and the lived experience of queer people. Rather than rushing into exploring, examining or criticising AI, we thought that mapping out what queerness means to us was necessary. It also means we can bring our queer strategies into the following workshop - the strategies can act as an anchor so we don’t get lost, and something we can return to throughout. 



## Taking this forward 



We are continuously learning about best practices and tools for running workshops like these, and we’re indebted to practitioners like Chloe and MELT for helping us create spaces where we hope people feel safe, present and able to connect with others. It’s a process, and we hope to keep improving. 



Some things that worked well from feedback we received; ‘ the group building activity, the openness and the safe space’. Including a mini group building activity at the beginning of each workshop would be fun, starting the day with some queer silliness and joy. 



We will definitely explore ways we can include group building activities into the upcoming workshops, even if it is just for 10 minutes before we begin the session. 



The standout theme that came out of this day was our interconnectedness - as queer people, as people living in Bristol, as neurodivergent people, as people who use technology. 



We are really excited to keep exploring these themes and more throughout the rest of the year.
