Our final workshop as a cohort did not end up going to plan - there was a sudden light snow storm in Bristol which meant it wasn’t a great day to be travelling, so we decided to run the workshop online. It seemed fitting that for a programme looking at the dystopian and apocalyptic effects of Big Tech we would have to pivot for an unexpected climate event. It was also a small exercise in seeing how our strategies as a community could help us stay connected and work together remotely. 

We started the workshop looking at two examples of other manifestos that have been an inspiration to us:

## 
The Feminist Server Manifesto 



<https://hub.xpub.nl/systers/mediawiki/index.php?title=A_Feminist_Server_Manifesto>

This is a manifesto that was written collectively, at an event hosted by Constant, a non-profit, artist-run organization in Brussels. It is list of short statements and provocations, such as:

A feminist server…

* Is a situated technology. She has a sense of context and considers herself to be part of an ecology of practices
* Treats network technology as part of a social reality
* Takes the risk of exposing her insecurity



## The manifesto on Algorithmic Sabotage



<https://algorithmic-sabotage.github.io/asrg/manifesto-on-algorithmic_sabotage/> 

This manifesto, in it’s own words “articulates a systematically structured sequence of ten distinct propositions, enumerated from 0 to 9, each delineating the underlying principles, strategic approaches, and aesthetic manifestations that shape the critical concept of “algorithmic sabotage””

It was written by the Algorithmic Sabotage Research Group (ASRG) a group looking at artistic activism around AI and Big Data.

It contains a numbered list with statements such as:

* “Algorithmic Sabotage” is a figure of techno-disobedience for the militancy that’s absent from technology critique
* “Algorithmic Sabotage” is an action-oriented commitment to solidarity that precedes any system of social, legal or algorithmic classification.
* “Algorithmic Sabotage” refuses algorithmic humiliation for power and profit maximisation, focusing on activities of mutual aid and solidarity.”

We discussed what we liked and what didn’t work for us - for instance, it was great that they were in an accessible format, with the ASRG also maintaining many translations, but we would have preferred more accessible language for non-academic or non-technical audiences. We were also hesitant about the Feminist Server referring to the server in human language, “she”, as we’ve discussed how problematic personifying tools can be.

Mapping areas and harms


For our next exercise we looked at a process from the fantastic “Teaching AI” book, and also inspired by Kate Crawford’s amazing Atlas of AI, in order to get a shared understanding of what we’re talking about when we talk about AI.



> The instructions from “Teaching AI” were:
>
> I. Think of a technology which uses Al. This could be a hardware e.g. Alexa, a smartphone, or, this could be a software like ChatGPT or DALL-E.
>
> II. Map the component parts within and around this technology. Ask yourself what happened to make this tech-piece happen? What resources, material or immaterial? What conditions are behind these processes? Focus on material resources, human labour, and data. 
>
> III. Questions you might try to answer in the building of this map include: Where does its data come from (e.g. sensors, satellites, machine learning models, APIs)? How is the physical aspect of this product made? Where is the data stored? Where are the servers ? How are they made? Who manufactures them? Who is employed to work there? How much are they paid? Where do these materials come from? Where are they mined? What is the history of these sites of extraction? What happens when this product is disposed of, what's its afterlife?
>
> IV. Try to ground this exercise in specificity. Find out which materials are
>
> mined from which locations. Which exact communities are affected, etc. If you are struggling to find this out from online research, try a touch of investigative journalism on the companies or manufacturers of the products, items, sensors, batteries, etc.
>
>
> V. Map this complexity and supply chain on the big piece of paper, trying to build as complete and granular a picture as you can. Include imagery, sketches and diagrams.



We did this in pairs on an online diagram making tool, and then came together to talk about our maps.

It was a really great way to just get a sense of the sheer scale and many, many interweaving systems at play.

We touched on the impact of increased water use for cooling data centres, to AI being used in script writing in Hollywood, to the lives of exploited ghost workers training data sets.

It’s going to be impossible for us to ever really address everything about AI, but we agreed that just the act of knowledge sharing and divesting as a small community was a good step in the right direction.



## First sketch of a manifesto



For the next part of the workshop, we took the 6 main areas that had come out of the mapping exercise, and split into groups to start drafting some statements under each area.

As we had done in the previous exercise with Batool, we used the operations from Queering Damage as a loose framework:

You can see some of our messy and chaotic conversation here:

<https://pad.constantvzw.org/p/machinestreams> 

Some key takeaways for us:

* Resistance was the overarching emergent theme - how can we resist the harms as individuals and communities, and how can we protest safely
* Joy and queer community also emerged - we want to celebrate our connection with each other, with the natural world, our ability to use technology in a way that is sustainable, and speak to a future that is positive for queer people.

Over the next month or so we will be tidying up the work we did and sharing it in accessible formats. 

We want the manifesto to both be a provocation and a toolkit if possible. We’d like to share our values alongside resources for people learning about AI and how to resist it. We also want it to be a living document that anyone can edit. Although many of our workshops revealed the power and insidiousness of AI, we’ve also come to understand more about the power we hold as a collective, and how we can stand in solidarity with each other as queer people.
