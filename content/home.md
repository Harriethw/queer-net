  - name: "Fertile Grounds: A Conversation with Andrew Mallinson (Feminist Internet)
      22/10/24"
    description: >-
      Queerness finds its centre within our cities — bodies together, meeting,
      making, whose actions radiate outwards, drawing others in. Cities create a
      framework for community, offering safety in numbers. But what of bodies
      that exist outside the sanctuary of the city, of a queerness that tries to
      sow its seeds in country fields?


      Often, to be visibly queer in rural contexts is to exist at the margin — hyper-visible. The rural has its own centre, a rigid orthodoxy that rarely offers itself as fertile grounds for queerness. For many queer people in these communities, the screen becomes a means of escape, creating portals to our cities. Yet technology is more than a pathfinder; it offers the means of rendering the body anew, forming communities in virtual paradises.


      Join us for a conversation on the relationship between queerness, the rural, and technology, hosted by Feminist Internet co-founder Andrew Mallinson. By looking to technology as a way of building bridges, we will question how we can de-centre queerness from our cities. Can we envision a model of queerness that thrives in the countryside? What might a rural framework for queerness look like?

  - name: "Voice Profiling and Resistance: A Talk with Amina Abbas-Nazari 27/09/24"
    description: "The sounding of and listening to voices is increasingly mediated
      by artificially intelligent machine listening and conversational systems
      (such as Amazon's Alexa). These systems profile voices to surveil, analyse
      and understand people in ways which are normative, over-simplistic and
      ultimately harmful to those who are marginalised within society. In this
      event, Amina Abbas-Nazari will present their PhD research that
      investigates these issues and propose ways to reveal and resist voice
      profiling in and by AI, through an expanded understanding of the sounding
      of voice. "
